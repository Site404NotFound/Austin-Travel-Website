    <p>
      While Austin may not be known as the city that never sleeps, thereâ€™s always a constant bustling.  With the influx of
      new residents and tourists, the city is regularly changing its face.  Growing and adapting to reflect the dichotomy of art and technology
      that the city has become associated with.  A fellow Austinite named Andrew Takano (<a href="http://highfieldmedia.com/">Highfield Media</a>)
      has done an excellent job capturing the essence of the city.  He's prefectly seized Austin's beauty with his intricate time-lapse and hyper-lapse cinematography.
      Be sure to check out his website and maybe even get some merch.
